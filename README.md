WILSON WORDLE WIZARD
====================

Welcome to my wordle solver, an interactive terminal application to assist you in your all your wordle needs

About
----------

This script is build using Node and Typescript. (Sorry, not sorry)


How it works
------------
After the user inputs a word and their response from Wordle the script filters through ~5700 possible 5-letter words stored in a dictionary.json file to find possible solutions

Usage
-----
1. Clone this project
2. As this is built using node you will first need to install [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
3. Open up you terminal and cd into the directory that this has been cloned into
4. Run `npm i`
5. Then once everything is installed, this can be run using `npx node lib/index.js`
